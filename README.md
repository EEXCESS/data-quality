# data-quality

This package provides a library to create statistics about the input data  

The library processes the data as provided by the partners data stores as XML ( JSON is transformed to XML before)

The actual implementation provides basic checks:
* fields/record (min, max, average)
* empty fields/record
* controlled terms / record
